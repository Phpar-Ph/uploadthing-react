# 📁 UploadThing Integration – MERN Stack Experiment

This project showcases a hands-on experiment where I integrated **UploadThing**, a modern file upload service, into a **MERN Stack** application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## 🚀 Overview

**UploadThing** is a developer-friendly upload handler built for modern frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, and **Vite**. In this experiment, I used it to handle file uploads and built full CRUD support for managing images.

## 🔧 What I Built

- ✅ **Image Upload:** Upload images using UploadThing from the frontend
- ✅ **MongoDB Integration:** Store image URLs in a MongoDB collection
- ✅ **Delete Functionality:** Remove images from both UploadThing and MongoDB
- ✅ **User-Friendly UI:** Simple React interface for testing the upload and delete flow

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **File Handling:** UploadThing

## 🎯 Purpose & Learning

This is part of my **learning journey in web development**, where I continuously experiment with modern tools and services to improve my skills. By implementing UploadThing in a MERN project, I practiced real-world scenarios like:

- Handling cloud-based file uploads
- Managing backend and frontend data flow
- Ensuring cleanup of storage and database entries
- Working with asynchronous operations and RESTful endpoints

## 💡 Personal Reflection

> “I believe every challenge has a solution — with enough determination and persistence, you can build anything.”

This experiment reminded me that practical implementation is key to mastering web technologies.
